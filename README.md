**GSAN** is a tool that can extract [Subject Alternative Names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_Alternative_Name) found in SSL Certificates _directly_ from https web sites which can provide you with DNS names (subdomains) or virtual servers.

This tool extract subdomain names from http**s** sites and return a list or CSV/JSON output of its findings. It is _**not**_ a subdomain brute-force tool, and you can [actually find those subdomains manually](https://gfycat.com/AnotherDizzyDodobird), this tools is about the automation of that process, it also offers the following features:

* Define multiple hosts:port on your terminal or using a text file.
* CSV or JSON output, useful if you want to export data into other tools.
* You can _optionally_ filter out domain names that doesn't match the domain name that you're analyzing.
* Integration with CRT.SH so you can extract more subdomains from certificates of the same entity.
* Also works with **Self-signed** certificates.

## Installation
```bash
$ pip install --user gsan
```

## Usage

You have 2 ways of executing GSAN, getting subdomain names from CRT.SH, in which GSAN acts as a wrapper for CRT.SH, or getting subdomain names by directly connecting

```
Usage: gsan [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Get subdomain names from SSL Certificates.

Options:
  --version  Show the version and exit.
  --help     Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  crtsh  Get domains from crt.sh
  scan   Scan domains from input or a text file, format is HOST[:PORT].
```

### Getting subdomains from CRT.SH
If you prefer to get the subdomain names directly from CRT.SH you can do that by using the subcomand `crtsh`.

```bash
$ gsan crtsh --help
Usage: gsan crtsh [OPTIONS] [DOMAINS]...

  Get domains from crt.sh

Options:
  -m, --match-domain     Match domain name only.
  -o, --output TEXT      Output to path/filename.
  -t, --timeout INTEGER  Set timeout for CRT.SH
  --help                 Show this message and exit.

### Getting subdomains directly from SSL certificates
Most programs that _"abuse"_ transparency certificates are only a wrapper for crt.sh, however you can extract subdomain names directly from SSL certificates found in HTTPS services. This allows you to find subdomain names in services that have self-signed certificates or deployed services that are not found anywhere. You can do this using the subcomand `scan`.

```bash
$ gsan scan --help
Usage: gsan scan [OPTIONS] [HOSTNAMES]...

  Scan domains from input or a text file, format is HOST[:PORT].

  e.g: gsan scan domain1.com domain2.com:port

  You can also pass a text file instead, just replace the first domain
  argument for a file. eg: gsan scan filename.txt

  If no ports are defined, then gsan assumes the port 443 is available.

Options:
  -o, --output TEXT      Output to path/filename.
  -m, --match-domain     Match domain name only.
  -c, --crtsh            Include results from CRT.SH
  -t, --timeout INTEGER  Set timeout [default: 3]
  --help                 Show this message and exit.

17                    fr.app.starbucks.ca
```

You can also pass a list of hosts their ports, formatted as host[:port] (port is optional), and gsan will go through them trying to extract subdomain names. You can use the same subcomand `scan` and pass a text file as argument instead of a domain name:

```bash
gsan scan hosts.txt -o subdomains.csv
